# Logic-Gates-using-CMOS
This project involves the design and simulation of CMOS-based logic gates, including NAND & XOR gates. The goal is to develop efficient, low-power digital circuits using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which is widely used in modern electronic devices.
## software and tools used :

- Xschem 
- Ngspice

## NAND CMOS Schematic
